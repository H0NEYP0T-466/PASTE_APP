# 📋 Paste

**Paste** is a lightweight and responsive web application built with React that allows users to manage simple text or code-based notes. Each paste includes a title and description, with full support for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete (CRUD)** operations.

Users can:
- 🆕 Add new pastes with a title and description  
- ✏️ Edit and update existing pastes  
- 👁️ View all saved pastes in a scrollable list  
- 📋 Copy content to the clipboard with a single click  
- 🗑️ Delete notes or code snippets easily
